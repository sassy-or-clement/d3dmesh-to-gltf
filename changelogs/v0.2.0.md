# Additional features

Added three new features/improvements:

* added options `--disable-d3dmesh-conversion` nad `--disable-skl-conversion` to selectively disable conversions of either file types
* normal maps of type `RGB8` are now used without any further conversion (no error on unknown normal map type)
* the alpha mode of a material is now selected based on the diffuse texture: if the texture contains alpha values, the mode is `blend` otherwise `opaque`
